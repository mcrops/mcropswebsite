      <p>Review meeting with NaCRRI
The Mobile crop surveillance team is collaborated with the NACRRI of NARO on some activities in the last quarter of 2014 including, a national Cassava Health survey and team trainings on survey. The results of these activities were reviewed at this evaluation meeting. Trip Brief The Mcrops team set off at about half past 9 o'clock on the morning of Monday the 23rd February after receiving solid confirmation from the host NaCRRI. The team traveled by public means taking in turns 2 route taxis and one section by motor bike to reach the last section to the NaCRRI premises. We encountered great challenge with time keeping for the appointments while using public means where we were delayed by an hour and a quarter to our appointment The team was made up of only three members; Mutembesa Daniel, Ninsiima Flavia and Nsumba Solomon. We were received by Mr. Abidrabo Phillip, with whom He and the other team were supposed to have a feedback section before our meeting with Dr. Chris Omong. Unfortunately, NaCRRI was attending to their governing body visitation and we had to have a combined meeting later about half past 2 o'clock that afternoon. The meeting main covered four main areas which are ; 1. brief meeting style reports from both Mcrops & NaCRRI teams on the outputs of the ODK tool during survey and pre-survey activities. This included some detail on number of images captured, quality of trainings, challenges faced among others. 2. Evaluations of the tool specifically were given and improvements suggested. Under this we had a lot of support for a GPS incorporated tool to reduce on the lag of data capture. It was also note that some NaCRRI members did record more data than formerly suggested in the SOPs. 3. Results of the post survey were presented, these, mainly from the side of Mrops including ; maps , data collected, presentations, a standard cleaning protocol for annotating crop images, a white-fly count application first version release and a scoring application. Commentary was made on the results achieved from the hosting side. More notably issues to concern the white-fly application which still covers many double or triple flies for one, which could be resolved by the feature that an adult white-fly is at most 1.5mm long. 4. The prospected future activities and works were also shared where the Mcrops teams was encouraged to make more trips to NaCRRI , Namulonge to learn more and better about the features and aspects of the vectors and diseases in focus. Also request was made a personnel to aide in the scoring of the clean data sets of both foliar and root data to which effect it necessitates an official letter with terms Abstract work was also shared with Dr. Chris Omongo. The presentations to be made in Nairobi were also discussed.</p>
